**Background**
--
I needed to have a book on hand at all times. Since all the other solutions here are in python, I had to write a script in BASH.

**Installation**
--
To install files:
`````
git clone https://github.com/SysAdmln/calameo-download-pdf
`````
MacOS
`````
brew install imagemagick
`````
Debian
`````
apt install imagemagick
`````
**Usage**
`````
cd calameo-download-pdf
`````

chmod +x ./calameo.sh
`````
`````
./calameo.sh url
